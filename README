This is a bunch of utilities that I have put together that may (not) be useful for you.  
See the wiki pages for more information on the tools:

[[FileHashTools]]  
FileHashTools is a tool that lets you work with checksums and files. It can be used to verify checksums that are embedded in filenames, or it can be used to create/verify checksum files.

[[printhash]]  
printhash is just a simple script that will print out the md5 or crc for a given file.

[[stdinhelper]]  
I can't really remember what this does yet.

[[subextractreplace]]  
subextractreplace lets you extract subtitles from a lot of mkv's. It also lets you replace certain tokens in those subtitles, and then if you wish, you can remux it back into mkv.

[[treeprinter]]  
treeprinter lets you view a filesystem hierarchy starting where you please, and will display information about files in a format you specify. See wiki (or conf file) for information available to print.

[[util]]  
A simple helper module with utilities to help me do basic things quickly.

[[whatever2utf8]]  
whatever2utf8 is a simple script that will take one file and try to convert it from the encoding you specify to UTF-8 (with optional BOM marker)
