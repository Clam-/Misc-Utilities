This is a bunch of utilities that I have put together that may (not) be useful for you.  
See the wiki pages for more information on the tools:

dropboxlog  
Tool to parse dumb Dropbox logs that embed JSON in to the 10th field. Converts it to plan CSV.

[dirsymsync](https://github.com/Clam-/Misc-Utilities/wiki/dirsymsync)  
dirsymsync is a service that will synchronise two folders with one symlinking files to the other to get the effect of a "write once" "disallow delete" type scenario.

[FileHashTools](http://github.com/Clam-/Misc-Utilities/wiki/FileHashTools)  
FileHashTools is a tool that lets you work with checksums and files. It can be used to verify checksums that are embedded in filenames, or it can be used to create/verify checksum files.

[printhash](http://github.com/Clam-/Misc-Utilities/wiki/printhash)  
printhash is just a simple script that will print out the md5 or crc for a given file.

[stdinhelper](http://github.com/Clam-/Misc-Utilities/wiki/stdinhelper)  
stdhelper can take a file and normal stdin and pass it to a specified program, optionally able to delay input. UNIX ONLY (at this point in time.)

[subextractreplace](http://github.com/Clam-/Misc-Utilities/wiki/subextractreplace)  
subextractreplace lets you extract subtitles from a lot of mkv's. It also lets you replace certain tokens in those subtitles, and then if you wish, you can remux it back into mkv.

[treeprinter](http://github.com/Clam-/Misc-Utilities/wiki/treeprinter)  
treeprinter lets you view a filesystem hierarchy starting where you please, and will display information about files in a format you specify. See wiki (or conf file) for information available to print.

[util](http://github.com/Clam-/Misc-Utilities/wiki/util)  
A simple helper module with utilities to help me do basic things quickly.

[whatever2utf8](http://github.com/Clam-/Misc-Utilities/wiki/whatever2utf8)  
whatever2utf8 is a simple script that will take one file and try to convert it from the encoding you specify to UTF-8 (with optional BOM marker)
